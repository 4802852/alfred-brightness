# alfred-brightness

Alfred Workflow for setting Display Brightness.

This is modified version of **alfred-brightness** by fniephaus (https://github.com/fniephaus/alfred-brightness). Because it is not working since macos 12.3, I made a new one based on **brightness** by nriley (https://github.com/nriley/brightness) and **alfred workflow py3** by NorthIsUp (https://github.com/NorthIsUp/alfred-workflow-py3)

Thanks to all of them!

You can use all function of alfred-brightness workflow by fniephaus including current brightness.

If you want some guide to use this workflow, visit fniepahus.

This is only tested at Monteray 12.6 and Alfred 5.

If you have any issue, please let me know.
