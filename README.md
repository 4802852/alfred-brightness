# alfred-brightness

Alfred Workflow to set Display Brightness.

Only tested at Monteray 12.6 and Alfred 5 with no Python 2 env.

This is modified version of **alfred-brightness** by fniephaus (https://github.com/fniephaus/alfred-brightness), based on **brightness** by nriley (https://github.com/nriley/brightness) and **alfred workflow py3** by NorthIsUp (https://github.com/NorthIsUp/alfred-workflow-py3).

Thanks to all of them!

This is made because fniepahus version didn't work since macOS 12.3 because it only works based on Python 2.

You can use all functions of alfred-brightness workflow by fniephaus including current brightness. If you want some guide to use this workflow, visit fniephaus.
